## 🚀 Strategy Tips

*   **Communication is Key**: Use the chat to share information (or spread misinformation!).
*   **Trust No One**: Even your best friend might be a wolf in disguise.
*   **Use Abilities Wisely**: The Witch only has one of each potion per game. The Seer should be careful not to reveal themselves too early.
